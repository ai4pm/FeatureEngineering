**Codes.zip**

Extract Codes.zip and place the contents in the root directory.

`main.py` - This is the main Python script to be executed. It processes the data and performs the feature engineering comparisons.

`main.sh` - This is the shell script to run the main Python script using SLURM for job scheduling. Ensure SLURM is configured in your environment.

**Running the codes**

STEP 1 - Download the required dataset as per the instructions provided here: https://github.com/ai4pm/MultiEthnicMachineLearning

STEP 2 - Run `main.py` with input arguments using the following command:

```sh
python main.py <cancer_type> <omics_feature_type> <clinical_outcome_endpoint> <event_time_threshold> <target_DDP_group>
```

After execution, the result will be saved in the `Result` folder under the `Codes` folder as an Excel file.

STEP 3 - For different feature engineering methods, the following commands should be modified in the `main.py` file.

For ANOVA based feature selection method, set the following: 

```sh
AE=False and PCA_FE_All=False
```

For PCA based dimensionality reduction method, set the following: 

```sh
AE=False and PCA_FE_All=True
```

For AE-1 based feature extraction method, set the following: 

```sh
AE=True
EncoderActivation = 'linear'
DecoderActivation = 'linear'
LossFunction = 'mean_squared_error'
PCA_FE_All=False
```

For AE-2 based feature extraction method, set the following: 

```sh
AE=True
EncoderActivation = 'relu'
DecoderActivation = 'sigmoid'
LossFunction = 'binary_crossentropy'
PCA_FE_All=False
```
